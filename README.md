firefox only!
font arimo has to be installed on local system

## current syntax
The available syntax is mainly [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), with some added tags for our specific needs.
### Headings
\#, \## and \### are converted into Headings 1, 2 and 3
### Text 
Text without any syntax is interpreted as normal text. It is also possible to use “[note]”. Large texts are created by using “[big]”. Using “*” creates list elements. Empty lines between paragraphs are automatically converted into breaks. It is possible to add additional breaks using “[break]”.
### Images
To add images use the following syntax “[image] (Koala.jpg, This is the label of ’DEMO-KOALA’ , ’http://www.koalas-reference.com')”. The first parameter indicates the image url, the second is the label that is shown below the image and the third parameter is the image reference used to create image tables.
### slides
To create multiple slides use "---" for slide breaks.
